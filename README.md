I reflect on myself thrice a day,
How can I save on gas without delay?
How can I maintain my car with ease?
And how can I avoid drunk driving fees?
The price of gas is a constant betrayal,
Today it's up, tomorrow it may fail.

How to use it

To save on gas, I seek a clever way,
The ICBC card offers tips, they say.
With a 50% discount, it's a smart move,
For saving money on gas, they approve.
Saving more than just a few drops of fuel,
A cup of coffee from ICBC, it's cool.
 
With the ICBC card in hand,
Three provinces are easy to command.
